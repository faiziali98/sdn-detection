# sdn-detection

With the advent of IoT (Internet of things), huge prospect arises in terms of automation and productivity of Industry 4.0. Probability of getting new security threats for different new devices and unknown attacks is also arising. Typical security measures like antivirus, patches etc. are mostly host based which won't work properly for maintaining the security of IoT devices. In our project, we evaluate a new anomaly detection technique for these devices which is more behavioral and network based. We use unsupervised machine learning (ML) base approach to find DDoS attacks in real time scenario. A small set of features from the incoming traffic is used after grouping the packets in time epochs. In our work, we exhibit that the predictability of benign TCP traffic from IoT device can be used to detect attack traffic.
